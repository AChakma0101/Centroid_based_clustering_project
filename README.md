### Project Title
**Building an Unsupervised Centroid-based Clustering Model**

### Description
This project entails EDA (exploratory data analysis) of wine data grown in a particular region in Italy. The model is built using a simple and widely-used _unsupervised_ centroid-based clustering algorithm, k-means. Its objective is to reveal or predict subgroups of wines, grown in a particular region in Italy, based on their chemical analysis reports. The sample dataset provides the quantities of 13 constituents from 178 wines: alcohol, malic acid, ash, alcalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanod phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, od280/od315 of diluted wines, and proline.

There is necessary `code` to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing as wells as visualizing _descriptive statistics_.

### Files used
* The wine dataset is built into scikit-learn.
